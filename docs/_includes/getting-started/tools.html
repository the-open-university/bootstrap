  <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootlint">Bootlint</a></strong> is the official OU ICE HTML <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)">linter</a> tool. It automatically checks for several common HTML mistakes in webpages that are using OU ICE in a fairly "vanilla" way. Vanilla OU ICE's components/widgets require their parts of the DOM to conform to certain structures. Bootlint checks that instances of OU ICE components have correctly-structured HTML. Consider adding Bootlint to your OU ICE web development toolchain so that none of the common mistakes slow down your project's development.</p>
